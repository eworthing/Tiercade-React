# Tiercade React Native App (Phase 2+)

This directory is reserved for the future React Native / Expo app.

During Phase 1 of the migration, all new work should focus on:

- `apps/web` – React web app
- `packages/core` – TypeScript port of TiercadeCore
- `packages/state` – Redux Toolkit store and slices
- `packages/ui` – Shared React UI components
- `packages/theme` – Design tokens

Do not initialize the React Native app here until Phase 2 is explicitly started.
